I think some where along the line I messed up my pathing. I had to type out Horiseon-Challenge-main/Develop/index.html to get my link to work correctly. <br />

<a href="https://dmorrel7.github.io/Urban-Octo-Telegram/Horiseon-Challenge-main/Develop/index.html">https://dmorrel7.github.io/Urban-Octo-Telegram/Horiseon-Challenge-main/Develop/index.html</a>

HTML Changes <br />

Head <br />
    Changed the Title of the site from website to Urban-Octo-Telegram <br />
Body <br />  
    Changed div element to header. <br />
    Header <br />
        Added an a href to Horiseon to make it bring you back to the homepage incase more pages are added. <br />
        Changed div to nav element. <br />
    Hero <br />
        Changed div element to section. <br />
    Content <br />
        Changed div element to section element. <br />
        Gave search-engine-optimization an id so it can be clicked on in the header and it takes you to that spot on the website. <br />
        Added alt tags to all three of the pictures. <br />
        Gave all the h2 a class of content2. <br />
    Benefits <br />
        Changed div class to section. <br />
        Deleted all the classes inside the divs. <br />
    Footer <br />
        Changed footer from a div class to an Element. <br />



CSS Changes <br />

Labeled different sections of css to what they are directed towards. <br />
Took all of the . out of the header since its an element and not a class anymore. <br />
In the Benefits and Contents section refactored a lot of CSS that was the same into small bits of code and moved them around as needed. <br />
Took all of the . out of footer since it is now an elemnt not a class <br />
